# Robo Rhinos FTC Team 11254 Website

A lightweight, single-file website for **Robo Rhinos (FTC Team 11254)** hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new public repository named `roborrhinos11254.github.io` (or any name you prefer).
2. Upload `index.html`, `README.md`, and the `.github/workflows/pages.yml` from this repo.
3. Push to `main`. GitHub Actions will deploy automatically.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/` or `https://roborrhinos11254.github.io/` if using that name.

## Local Edits
- Edit `index.html` directly for content changes (About, Team, Season, Sponsors, etc.).
- Replace placeholder images/logos as desired.
- Update the `founding` year in the inline script to auto-calc "Years Competing".

## Calendar Integration
- The page includes one-click subscribe links for Apple, Outlook, and Google Calendar using your Band.us ICS feed.
- The embedded Google Calendar uses the public embed URL and **America/Detroit** timezone.

## Contact Form
- The form uses a placeholder Formspree endpoint. Replace `https://formspree.io/f/your-id` with your real endpoint or another backend.
